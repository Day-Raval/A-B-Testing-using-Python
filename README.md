A/B Testing means analyzing two marketing strategies to choose the best marketing strategy that can convert more traffic into sales (or more traffic into your desired goal) effectively and efficiently. In this project, we analyze the results of two marketing strategies to choose the best one for future marketing campaigns. Your goal is to boost sales, followers, or traffic, but choose the best marketing strategy according to the results of our previous marketing campaigns. The project showcases visualizations and analysis on certain common parameters between the two marketing strategies and guides on which strategy would work best for any social media platform.
