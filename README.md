A/B Testing means analyzing two marketing strategies to choose the best marketing strategy that can convert more traffic into sales (or more traffic into your desired goal) effectively and efficiently. The project showcases visualizations and analysis on certain common parameters between the two marketing strategies and guides on which strategy would work best for any social media platform. A/B testing is one of the valuable concepts that every Data Science professional should know.
